use stack or queue to gather data on map
find kirby on map
find cake on map
if more than 1 room, check first room for cake
if no cake, check for door
find shortest route
recreate map with route labeled in "+"
create a coord map for only route
if can't access cake, print "The cake is a lie."

***
Your program needs to support the following command line arguments: (a switch is set if it appears on the command line)

--Stack (boolean) If this switch is set, use the stack-based approach
--Queue (boolean) If this switch is set, use the queue-based approach
--Opt (boolean) If this switch is set, find the shortest path
--Time (boolean) If this switch is set, print the runtime of the program as described above.
--Incoordinate (boolean) If this switch is set, the input file is in the coordinate-based system. 
							If the switch is not set, the input file is in the text-map format.
--Outcoordinate (boolean) If this switch is set, the output file is in the coordinate-based system. 
							If the switch is not set, the output file is in the text-map format.
--Help (boolean) If this switch is set, print out a brief, informative message on what your program 
				is suppose to do, including what the switches are and what they do. 
				Your program should then exit(0).
